# Lab 7 - Local Agnostic Methods

## Partial Dependence Plot (PDP)
- **Description**: Shows how a feature affects the predicted outcome on average.
- **Documentation**: [Partial Dependence Plot - Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/miscellaneous/plot_partial_dependence_visualization_api.html)

## Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) Plot
- **Description**: Like PDP, but shows the effect for each individual observation separately.

## Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) Plot
- **Description**: Better than PDP when features are correlated. Shows the effect of a feature by considering small changes.
- **Documentation**: [ALE Plot - Alibi Documentation](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/alibi/en/latest/examples/ale_classification.html)

## Permutation Feature Importance
- **Description**: Measures how much the model's performance drops when a feature's values are randomly shuffled.

## LOFO (Leave One Feature Out) Importance
- **Description**: Measures feature importance by removing one feature at a time and checking how the model's performance changes.

## Global Surrogate Model
- **Description**: Train a simple model (like decision tree) to approximate and explain the behavior of a complex model.

## Feature Interaction: H-Statistic
- **Description**: Measures how strongly two or more features interact and influence the prediction.

# Lab 8 - Global Agnostic Methods

## LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)
- **Description**: Explains a prediction by training a simple interpretable model around a local area of that prediction.
- **Documentation**: [LIME Documentation](https://lime-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- **Description**: Explains predictions by fairly distributing the contribution among features based on Shapley values from game theory.
- **Documentation**: [SHAP Documentation](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
